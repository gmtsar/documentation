Learning More About InSAR       
*************************

There are many resources available for those who want to learn more about
SAR data and InSAR processing. The list below includes helpful websites,
papers, and textbooks, but is by no means a comprehensive list.

SAR & InSAR Concepts
--------------------

Since the SAR field has been in development for decades, there is a wide variety 
of literature concerning every aspect of SAR data collection, processing, and 
results from InSAR analyses. 

NASA Earthdata has an overview page for SAR (with more resources at the bottom of the page):
https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/what-is-sar

In depth (all the nitty gritty details) Handbook on InSAR processing from the European Space Agency:
http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESA_Publications/InSAR_Principles_Guidelines_for_SAR_Interferometry_Processing_and_Interpretation_br_ESA_TM-19

Remote Sensing Concepts
-----------------------

If you’ve never taken or participated in a remote sensing class, it is often helpful 
to begin with reviewing the essentials of remote sensing particulars:

Natural Resources Canada provides a detailed review of remote sensing principles 
in their online materials (both html and pdf available):
https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/maps-tools-publications/satellite-imagery-air-photos/tutorial-fundamentals-remote-sensing/9309

NASA has a great (and shorter) web-based overview of the most important remote sensing 
concepts on their Earthdata website:
https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/remote-sensing

NASA also provides training courses for remote sensing applications through their 
Applied Remote Sensing Training program (ARSET) that are open to all -- there is a 
“Fundamentals of Remote Sensing” course, as well as a variety of use-specific trainings 
(some courses are also available in Spanish):

Interested in learning how to process InSAR data yourself? Check out UNAVCO (now EarthScope
Consortium | SAGE/GAGE Facilities) short courses for the GMTSAR processing course in order to 
learn to how to use GMTSAR software through group instruction.
