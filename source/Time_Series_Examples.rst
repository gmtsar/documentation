Step-by-Step Guide for Sentinel-1 Time Series
---------------------------------------------

We currently have a time series documentation written in the form of an
example working with data that spans the deformation around the Kilauea volcano
on the big island of Hawaii. This guide takes a user step by step through each
necessary piece of the workflow, from downloading your data and supporting data,
to directory structure, to each of the GMTSAR tools you will need to use.
