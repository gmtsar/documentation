        To process an interferogram you need to download two SAR images from the
        same satellite, same satellite track, and that overlap in space

        You will need to provide the orbital information for each of the SAR images
        you wish to process. This information is usually available from the same place
        you downloaded data. You will need one orbit file for each image.
